# Convolutional Neural Network to Classify Major Depressive Disorder
In this project, we built a CNN to classify depression using 3D MRIs in the form of .nii images.

## Dataset
We used the PAC2018 Dataset (http://www.photon-ai.com/pac).

Data can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PNoajlvToiMMzfD8fxDv_PEznIweqOMN.

Rename to a folder called 'nifiti' to run the models.

## Files
`overfitted_model.py` contains our first model which was overfitted.

`underfitted_model.py` contains our second model which was underfitted.

`best_model.py` contains our third model which performed the best.
